# list-with-filter
A textfield with Search capability on keyup and show the result in a List with Sorting and pagination

The api used here is the third party site i.e. http://5cdc339c069eb30014202b21.mockapi.io/api/v1/search
This is used so that we can mimic sort and filter functionality from the service as with infinite scrolling, the data will be dynamic.
And with dynamic data sorting should haapen in MT.

I created a class which can be a reusable stand alone component.

I used css and the parent class in each css just make it applicable to my component, which can be easily achieved using SASS.
I haven't used SASS as I need again a SASS compiler to convert it into css.
